# ðŸ§ª Blood test classifier

This project is a ML based decision tree classifier that analyses blood test results and classifies them as **Normal, Borderline, or Abnormal** based on predefined medical thresholds. Goal is over time to evolve it so it creates its own nodes and thresholds. 

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Generates fake blood tests with randomsied results
- Stores blood test results in an SQLite database
- Uses decision tree classification to categorize test results based on existing definintions 
- Working on ... 
- Working on ... Provides explainability for how the classifier makes predictions
- working on ... support continuous learning (updating with new data)
- Goal is to expanded with a Ruby API for real-time classification
- Goal is to expand with sequenced blood tests to see if the result of one blood test can predict the result of the following
